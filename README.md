## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system.

### Creating an environment file

Before committing your project, it's good practice to generate an `environment.yml` file. This will allow others to replicate your project's environment with ease.

You can do this by using the following command:

```bash
conda env export | grep -v "prefix: " > environment.yml
